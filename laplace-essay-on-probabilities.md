Every event, even those that by their minuteness seem not to hold to
the great laws of nature, follows them as necessarily as the
revolutions of the Sun. In our ignorance of the links that unite each
to the whole system of the universe, we made them depend on final
causes, or chance, by which they would occur and succeed one another
with regularity, or without apparent order; but these imaginary causes
successively retreated with the borders of our knowledge, and would
disappear wholly before the healthy philosophy that sees in them
only the expression of the ignorance actually due to ourselves.

Present events have, with preceding ones, a link founded on the
evident principle that one thing cannot begin to be without a cause
producing it. This axiom, known by the name of the *principle of
sufficient reason*, reaches even the actions we judge indifferent. The
freest will cannot, without a determining motive, give them birth; for
if, all the circumstances of two locations being exactly similar, it
were to act in one and refrain in the other, its choice would be an
effect without cause: it would then be, says Leibniz, the blind chance
of the Epicureans. The contrary opinion is an illusion of the mind
which, losing from view the fugitive reasons for the choice of the
will in indifferent things, is persuaded it determines itself by
itself and without motives.

So we ought to view the present state of the universe as the
effect of its previous state, and the cause of the next. An
intelligence who, at a given instant, were to know all the forces that
animate nature, and the respective situation of the beings composing
it, and further should be vast enough to subject this data to
analysis, would encompass in the same formula the movements of the
greatest bodies in the universe and the lightest atom: nothing would
be uncertain to it, and the future, like the past, would be present to
its eyes. The human mind offers, in the perfection it has been able to
give Astronomy, a feeble sketch of this intelligence. Its discoveries
in Mechanics and Geometry, along with that of universal gravity, have
set it in reach to comprehend in the same analytic expressions the
past and future states of the system of the world. In applying the
same method to some other objects of its knowledge, it succeeded in
ramifying into general laws the observed phenomena, and in foreseeing
which of the given circumstances should hatch. All these efforts in
the search for truth tend ceaselessly towards the intelligence we just
conceived, which will remain always infinitely distant. This tendency,
native to the human species, is what places it above the animals; and
its progress of this kind distinguishes nations and centuries, and
makes their true glory.

Recall that of yore, not so long ago, a rain or a drought, a comet
dragging a long-extended tail, the aurora borealis, and in general all
extraordinary phenomena, were seen as so many signs of heavenly ire.
We invoked the heavens to turn away their evil influence. We prayed
not at all to suspend the course of the planets and the Sun:
observation had quickly made felt the vanity of these prayers. But as
these phenomena appeared and vanished at long intervals, seeming to
oppose the order of nature, we supposed heaven, vexed by our earthly
crimes, gave birth to them to announce its revenges. Thus the long
tail of the comet of 1456 spread terror in a Europe already upset by
the rapid successes of the Turks who had just thrown down the Low
Empire. This star, after four of its revolutions, excited among us a
quite different interest. The knowledge of the laws of the system of
the world, gained in this interval, had dispelled the childish fears
due to ignorance of the true setting of man in the universe; and Halley,
having recognized the identity of this comet with those of 1531, 1607,
and 1682, announced its next return for the end of 1758 or the start
of 1759. The world awaited, with impatience, this return that ought to
confirm one of the greatest discoveries ever made in the sciences, and
fulfil the prediction of Seneca, when he said of the revolution of
those stars which descend from a vast distance: "The day will come
when, by a study pursued over many centuries, things currently hidden
will seem evident; and posterity will marvel that such clear truths
escaped us." Clairaut undertook then to subject to analysis the
perturbations the comet had felt by the action of the two largest
planets, Jupiter and Saturn; after immense calculations he fixed its
next passage to perihelion at the start of April 1759, which
observation did not take long to confirm. The regularity shown us by
Astronomy in the movement of comets has place, no doubt, in all
phenomena. The curve described by a simple molecule of air or of
vapors is ruled in a manner as certain as the planetary orbits: there
are no differences between these but those of our ignorance.

Probability is relative in part to this ignorance, in part to our
knowledge. We know that among three or a greater number of events, one
must happen; but nothing brings us to think that one will, rather than
the others. In this state of indecision, it is impossible for us to
pronounce with certainty upon their occurrence. It is, however, probable
that one of these events, taken at will, will not happen, because we
see many cases equally possible which exclude its occurrence, while
favoring only one.

The theory of chance consists in reducing all the events of the same
kind to a certain number of cases all equally possible, meaning such
that we are equally undecided about their occurrence; and to determine
the number of cases favorable to the event whose probability we
seek. The proportion of this number to that of all possible cases is
the measure of this probability, which thus is simply a fraction whose
numerator counts the favorable cases and whose denominator counts the
possible.

The above notion of probability implies that upon magnifying by the
same proportion both the favorable and the possible cases, the
probability remains the same. To be convinced of this, consider two
urns A and B, the first containing four white balls and two black, and
the second holding only two white balls and one black. You can imagine
the two black balls of the first urn bound by a thread which breaks
at the moment you grasp one of the balls to extract it, and the four
white balls forming two similar pairs. Every event of grasping one of
the balls of the black pair yields a black ball. If you suppose now
that the threads uniting the balls no longer break, it is clear that
the number of possible events will not change, nor will the number of
events favorable to the extraction of black balls; only, you will pull
from the urn two balls at once; hence the probability of producing a
black ball will be the same as at first. But then you have the case of
urn B, with the sole difference that the three balls of this urn be
replaced by three pairs of balls invariably bound.

`XXX 'every event' above for 'toutes les chances'. Does that confuse
meanings for 'event' which Laplace meant to keep apart?`

When every case is favorable to an event, its probability becomes
certainty, and its expression equal to unity. In this way certainty
and probability are comparable, whatever essential difference there
may be between the two states of the mind, when either a truth is
rigorously proved to it, or it sees still a small source of error.

For things that are only probable, the difference of data that each
man has about them is one of the main causes of the diversity of
opinions we see reigning over the same objects. Let us suppose, for
example, we have three urns A, B, C, with one containing only black
balls while the two others hold only white balls, we must pull a ball
from urn C, and we ask for the probability that this ball will be
black. If ignorant about which of the three urns it is that holds only
black balls, you would have no reason to believe it is C rather than B
or A; these three hypotheses would seem equally possible, and as a
black ball can only be extracted by the first hypothesis, the
probability of the extraction is equal to one third. If you knew that
urn A held only white balls, the indecision then would carry only to
urns B and C, and the probability that the ball out of urn C will be
black is one half. Lastly, this probability resolves to certainty if
you are assured that urns A and B hold only white balls.

In this way the same fact, recited before a numerous assembly, obtains
various degrees of credence, according to the extent of knowledge of
the audience. If the man who reports it is intimately persuaded, and
if, by his state and his character, he inspires great confidence; his
tale, however extraordinary it be, will have for unenlightened
listeners the same degree of probability as an ordinary fact reported
by the same man, and they will give him an entire faith. However if
some of them were to know that the same fact is rejected by other
equally-respectable men, it will be under doubt, and the fact will be
judged false by the enlightened listeners who will find it contrary to
either well-attested facts or the immutable laws of nature.

`XXX ajouteront: give?`

It is to the influence of the opinion of those whom the multitude
judge the best instructed, and to whom it has the custom of bestowing
its trust upon the most important objects of life, that is due the
propagation of those errors that, in the times of ignorance, covered
the face of the world. Magic and Astrology offer us two great
examples. These errors inculcated since childhood, adopted unchecked,
and having for basis only universal belief, maintained themselves
through a very long time, until at last the progress of the sciences
destroyed them in the minds of enlightened men, following which the
opinion was made to disappear even among the people by the power so
widespread in them of imitation and habit. This power, the most
powerful resort of the moral world, establishes and conserves in all
of a nation ideas wholly contrary to those that it maintains elsewhere
with the same empire. What indulgence do we not owe then towards
opinions different from ours, since this difference often depends
merely on the diverse points of view where circumstances place us! Let
us enlighten those we judge insufficiently instructed; but first of
all let us severely examine our own opinions, and with impartiality
weigh their respective probabilities.

`XXX first sentence above is too convoluted imho. And maybe something like 'following which' -> 'following whom'?`

The difference of opinions depends still on the way we determine the
influence of the known data. The theory of probabilities holds
considerations so delicate that it is not surprising that with the
same data, two people find different results, above all in very
complicated questions. We explain here the general principles of this
Theory.

**1st Principle.** The first of these principles is just the definition
of probability which, as we've seen, is the proportion of the number
of favorable cases to that of all cases possible.

**2nd Principle.** But that supposes the diverse cases equally
possible. If they are not, we will determine first their respective
possibilities, of which the just appreciation is one of the most
delicate points of the theory of chance. Then the probability will be
the sum of the possibilities of each favorable case. Let us clarify
this principle by an example.

Suppose we project into the air a broad and very thin coin whose two
large opposed faces, which we name *cross* and *pillar*, be perfectly
similar. We seek the probability of achieving *cross* at least once in
two tosses. It is clear there can occur four equally possible cases,
namely: *cross* on the first toss and the second; *cross* on the first
toss and *pillar* on the second; *pillar* first and *cross* second;
and finally *pillar* on both tosses. The first three cases are
favorable to the event we seek, whose probability is thus equal to
3/4; implying that it is three against one to bet that *cross* will
happen at least one time in two tosses.

`XXX pile = pillar? achieving/happening cross -> cross arriving?`

We can count in this game only three different cases, namely: *cross*
on the first toss, which dispenses with playing a second; *pillar* on
the first toss and *cross* on the second; and finally *pillar* on the
first and second tosses. This would reduce the probability to 2/3, if
we were to consider, with d'Alembert, these three cases as equally
possible. But it is visible that the probability of achieving *cross*
on the first toss is 1/2, while that of the two other cases is 1/4;
the first case being a simple event that corresponds to the two
compound events, *cross* on the first and second tosses, and *cross*
on the first toss, *pillar* on the second. Now if, conforming to the
second principle, we add the possibility 1/2 of *cross* on the first
toss, to the possibility 1/4 of *pillar* happening on the first toss
and *cross* on the second, we will have 3/4 for the probability
sought, which accords with what we found on the supposition of playing
both tosses. This supposition does not change in the least the outcome
we bet on for this event: it serves merely to reduce the diverse cases
to equally-possible ones.

**3rd Principle.** One of the most important points of the theory of
Probabilities, and the one that lends the most to illusions, is the
way the probabilites increase and decrease by their mutual
combinations. If the events are independent of each other, the
probability of their existing together is the product of their
particular probabilities. Thus the probability of achieving an ace
with a single die being a sixth, that of achieving two aces in rolling
two dice at once is a thirty-sixth. In fact, each of the faces of the
one die being combinable with the six faces of the other, there are
thirty-six equally possible cases, among which only one yields the two
aces. Generally, the probability that a simple event in the same
circumstances, will occur in sequence a given number of times, is
equal to the probability of this simple event, raised to a power
indicated by this number. As the successive powers of a fraction less
than unity diminish without cease, an event that depends on a series
of quite large probabilities can become extremely improbable. Suppose
that a fact reach us by twenty witnesses, in the manner that the first
transmit it to the second, the second to the third, and so on. Suppose
further that the probability of each testimony equal 9/10: that of the
fact, resulting from the testimonies, will be less than one
eighth. One cannot better compare this diminution of probability than
to the extinction of the light from objects, by the interposition of
multiple pieces of glass; an insignificant number of pieces sufficing
to conceal the sight of an object which a single piece leaves
distinctly perceptible. Historians seem not to have paid enough
attention to this degradation of the probability of facts, when seen
across a great many successive generations: many historical events,
reputed certain, would be at least doubtful, if submitted to this test.

In the purely mathematical sciences, the most distant consequences
partake of the certainty of the principle of which they derive. In the
applications of Analysis to Physics, the consequences have all the
certainty of facts or experiments. But in the moral sciences when
each consequence is deduced from the previous one in only a probable
way, the chance of error increases with their number, and finishes by
surpassing the chance of truth, in consequences very distant from the
beginning.

**4th Principle.** When two events depend one on the other, the
probability of the compound event is the product of the probability of
the first event, by the probability that, this event having happened,
the other does. . .
