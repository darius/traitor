# Philosophical Essay on Probabilities

This philosophical Essay grew out of a course on probabilities which I
gave in 1795 at the Ã‰coles Normales where I was professor of
Mathematics with Lagrange, by a decree of the National Convention. I
recently published on the same subject a work titled *Analytic Theory
of Probabilites*. I present here, without the aid of Analysis, the
principles and general results of this theory, applying them to the
chief questions of life, which are indeed, for the greatest part,
none but problems of probability. Strictly speaking, nearly all our
knowledge is no more than probable; and even in the few things we can know
for certain, in the mathematical sciences themselves, the principal
means for attaining truth -- induction and analogy -- are rooted in
probabilities; so the whole system of human knowledge is tied to the
theory exposed in this Essay. Therein will be seen, with undoubted
interest, that, even considering only the eternal principles of
reason, justice, and humanity, for the fortunate outcomes that are
constantly attached to them there is a great advantage in following
these principles, and grave inconveniences in straying from them:
their chances, like the favored ones in lotteries, in the end always
prevail over the swings of fortune. I desire that the reflections
spread throughout this Essay may deserve the attention of
philosophers, and direct them to an object so worthy to engage them.

## On probability

Every event, even those that by their minuteness seem not to hold to
the great laws of nature, follows them as necessarily as the
revolutions of the Sun. In our ignorance of the links that unite each
to the whole system of the universe, we made them depend on final
causes, or on chance, according to whether they occur and succeed one another
with regularity, or without apparent order; but these imaginary causes
have successively retreated with the borders of our knowledge, and
disappear wholly before the healthy philosophy that sees in them
only the expression of the ignorance actually due to ourselves.

Present events have, to the preceding ones, a link founded on the
evident principle that one thing cannot begin to be without a cause
producing it. This axiom, known by the name of the *principle of
sufficient reason*, reaches even the actions we judge indifferent. The
freest will cannot, without a determining motive, give them birth; for
if, all the circumstances of two locations being exactly similar, it
were to act in one and refrain in the other, its choice would be an
effect without cause: it would then be, says Leibniz, the blind chance
of the Epicureans. The contrary opinion is an illusion of the mind
which, losing from view the fugitive reasons for the choice of the
will in indifferent things, is persuaded it determines itself by
itself and without motives.

So we ought to view the present state of the universe as the
effect of its previous state, and the cause of the next. An
intelligence who, at a given instant, were to know all the forces that
animate nature, and the respective situation of the beings composing
it, and further should be vast enough to subject this data to
analysis, would encompass in the same formula the movements of the
greatest bodies in the universe and the lightest atom: nothing would
be uncertain to it, and the future, like the past, would be present to
its eyes. The human mind offers, in the perfection it has been able to
give Astronomy, a feeble sketch of this intelligence. Its discoveries
in Mechanics and Geometry, along with that of universal gravitation, have
set in reach the means to comprehend in the same analytic expressions the
past and future states of the system of the world. By applying the
same method to some other objects of its knowledge, it has succeeded in
attributing to general laws the phenomena observed, and in foreseeing
those which given circumstances should bring forth. All these efforts in
the search for truth ceaselessly tend to bring it closer to the intelligence we just
conceived, but from which it will forever remain infinitely distant. This tendency,
proper to the human race, is what places it above the animals; and
its progress of this kind distinguishes nations and centuries, and
makes their true glory.

Recall that of yore, and not so long ago, a deluge or a drought, a comet
dragging a long-extended tail, eclipses, the aurora borealis, and in general all
extraordinary phenomena, were regarded as so many signs of heavenly ire.
We implored heaven to deflect their evil influence. We prayed
not at all to suspend the course of the planets and the Sun:
observation had quickly made felt the vanity of these prayers. But as
these phenomena appearing and vanishing at long intervals seemed to
defy the order of nature, we supposed heaven, vexed by our earthly
crimes, gave birth to them to announce its revenges. Thus the long
tail of the comet of 1456 spread terror in a Europe already upset by
the rapid successes of the Turks who had just overthrown the Byzantine
Empire. This heavenly body, after four of its revolutions, excited among us a
quite different interest. The knowledge of the laws of the system of
the world, won in this interval, had dispelled the fears bred by
ignorance of the true setting of man in the universe; and Halley,
having recognized the identity of this comet with those of 1531, 1607,
and 1682, announced its next return for the end of 1758 or the start
of 1759. The learned world awaited, with impatience, this return which ought to
confirm one of the greatest discoveries ever made in the sciences, and
to fulfil the prediction of Seneca, when he said of the revolution of
these bodies that descend from a vast distance: "The day will come
when, by a study pursued over many centuries, things currently hidden
will seem evident; and posterity will marvel that such clear truths
escaped us." Clairaut undertook then to subject to analysis the
perturbations the comet had felt by the action of the two largest
planets, Jupiter and Saturn; after immense calculations he fixed its
next passage to perihelion towards the start of April 1759, which
observation did not take long to confirm. The regularity shown us by
Astronomy in the movement of comets has place, no doubt, in all
phenomena. The curve described by a simple molecule of air or of
vapors is ruled in a manner as certain as the planetary orbits: there
are no differences between these but those put there by our ignorance.

Probability is relative in part to this ignorance, in part to our
knowledge. {Suppose} we know that among three or a greater number of events, just one
must occur; but nothing brings us to think that one of them will, rather than
the others. In this state of indecision, it is impossible for us to
pronounce with certainty upon their occurrence. It is, however, probable
that one of these events, taken at will, will not happen, because we
see several equally possible cases that exclude its occurrence, while
only one favors it.

The theory of chance consists in reducing all the events of the same
kind to a certain number of cases all equally possible, meaning such
that we be equally undecided about their occurrence; and in determining
the number of cases favorable to the event whose probability we
seek. The proportion of this number to that of all possible cases is
the measure of this probability, which thus is simply a fraction whose
numerator counts the favorable cases and whose denominator counts the
possible.

The above notion of probability implies that upon magnifying by the
same proportion both the favorable and the possible cases, the
probability remains the same. To be convinced of this, consider two
urns A and B, the first containing four white balls and two black, and
the second holding only two white balls and one black. You can imagine
the two black balls of the first urn bound by a thread which breaks
at the moment you grasp one of the balls to extract it, and the four
white balls forming two similar pairs. Every event of grasping one of
the balls of the black pair yields a black ball. If you suppose now
that the threads uniting the balls no longer break, it is clear that
the number of possible events will not change, nor will the number of
events favorable to the extraction of black balls; only, you will pull
from the urn two balls at once; hence the probability of producing a
black ball will be the same as at first. But then you clearly have the case of
urn B, with the sole difference that the three balls of this urn be
replaced by three pairs of balls invariably bound.

When every case is favorable to an event, its probability becomes
certainty, and its expression equal to unity. In this way certainty
and probability are comparable, although there is an essential difference
in the two states of the mind, when either a truth is
rigorously proved to it, or it sees still a small source of error.

For things that are only plausible, the difference of data that each
man has about them is one of the main causes of the diversity of
opinions we see reigning over the same objects. Let us suppose, for
example, we have three urns A, B, C, with one containing only black
balls while the two others hold only white balls, we must pull a ball
from urn C, and we ask for the probability that this ball will be
black. If ignorant about which of the three urns it is that holds only
black balls, you would have no reason to believe it is C rather than B
or A; these three hypotheses would seem equally possible, and as a
black ball can only be extracted by the first hypothesis, the
probability of the extraction is equal to one third. If you knew that
urn A held only white balls, the uncertainty then would carry only to
urns B and C, and the probability that the ball out of urn C will be
black is one half. Lastly, this probability resolves to certainty if
you are assured that urns A and B hold only white balls.

In this way the same fact, recited before a numerous assembly, obtains
various degrees of credence, according to the extent of knowledge of
the listeners. If the man who reports it is intimately persuaded, and
if by his state and his character he inspires great confidence; his
tale, however extraordinary it be, will have for unenlightened
listeners the same degree of probability as an ordinary fact reported
by the same man, and they will give him an entire faith. However if
some of them were to know that the same fact is rejected by other
equally-respectable men, it will be under doubt, and the fact will be
judged false by the enlightened listeners who will find it contrary to
either well-attested facts or the immutable laws of nature.

It is to the influence of the opinion of those whom the multitude
judge the best educated, and to whom it has the custom of bestowing
its trust about the most important objects of life, that is due the
propagation of those errors that, in the times of ignorance, covered
the face of the world. Magic and Astrology offer us two great
examples. These errors inculcated since childhood, adopted unchecked,
and having for basis only universal belief, maintained themselves
through a very long time, until at last the progress of the sciences
destroyed them in the minds of enlightened men, whose opinion then
dissolved them even among the people, by the same power of imitation
and habit which had spread them so widely. This power, the mightiest
mean of the moral world, establishes and preserves in all
of a nation ideas wholly contrary to those that it maintains elsewhere
with the same empire. What indulgence do we not owe then towards
opinions different from ours, since this difference often depends
merely on the diverse points of view where circumstances place us! Let
us enlighten those we judge insufficiently educated; but first of
all let us severely examine our own opinions, and with impartiality
weigh their respective probabilities.

The difference of opinions depends as well on the way we determine the
influence of the known data. The theory of probabilities holds
considerations so delicate that it is not surprising that with the
same data, two people find different results, above all in very
complicated questions. We explain here the general principles of this
Theory.

## General principles of the calculus of Probabilities

**1st Principle.** The first of these principles is just the definition
of probability which, as we've seen, is the proportion of the number
of favorable cases to that of all cases possible.

**2nd Principle.** But that supposes the diverse cases equally
possible. If they are not, we will determine first their respective
possibilities, of which the just appreciation is one of the most
delicate points of the theory of chance. Then the probability will be
the sum of the possibilities of each favorable case. Let us clarify
this principle by an example.

Suppose we project into the air a broad and very thin coin whose two
large opposed faces, which we name *heads* and *tails*, be perfectly
similar. We seek the probability of achieving *heads* at least once in
two tosses. It is clear there can occur four equally possible cases,
namely: *heads* on the first toss and the second; *heads* on the first
toss and *tails* on the second; *tails* first and *heads* second;
and finally *tails* on both tosses. The first three cases are
favorable to the event we seek, whose probability is thus equal to
3/4; implying that it is three against one to bet that *heads* will
happen at least one time in two tosses.

We can count in this game only three different cases, namely: *heads*
on the first toss, which dispenses with playing a second; *tails* on
the first toss and *heads* on the second; and finally *tails* on the
first and second tosses. This would reduce the probability to 2/3, if
we were to consider, as d'Alembert, these three cases as equally
possible. But it is visible that the probability of achieving *heads*
on the first toss is 1/2, while that of the two other cases is 1/4;
the first case being a simple event that corresponds to the two
compound events, *heads* on the first and second tosses, and *cross*
on the first toss, *tails* on the second. Now if, conforming to the
second principle, we add the possibility 1/2 of *heads* on the first
toss, to the possibility 1/4 of *tails* happening on the first toss
and *heads* on the second, we will have 3/4 for the probability
sought, which accords with what we found on the supposition of playing
both tosses. This supposition does not change in the least the situation
of a bettor on this event: it serves merely to reduce the diverse cases
to equally-possible ones.

**3rd Principle.** One of the most important points of the theory of
Probabilities, and the one that lends itself the most to illusions, is the
way the probabilites increase and decrease by their mutual
combinations. If the events are independent of each other, the
probability of their existing together is the product of their
particular probabilities. Thus the probability of achieving an ace
with a single die being a sixth, that of achieving two aces in rolling
two dice at once is a thirty-sixth. Indeed, each of the faces of the
one die being combinable with the six faces of the other, there are
thirty-six equally possible cases, among which only one yields the two
aces. Generally, the probability that a single event in the same
circumstances occurs in sequence a given number of times is
equal to the probability of this single event, raised to a power
indicated by this number. As the successive powers of a fraction less
than unity diminish without cease, an event that depends on a series
of quite large probabilities can become extremely improbable. Suppose
that a fact reach us by twenty witnesses, in the manner that the first
transmit it to the second, the second to the third, and so on. Suppose
further that the probability of each testimony be 9/10: then that of the
fact resulting from the testimonies will be less than one
eighth. One cannot better compare this reduction of probability than
to the extinction of the brightness of objects, by the interposition of
multiple pieces of glass; an number of insignificant pieces sufficing
to conceal the sight of an object which a single piece leaves
distinctly perceptible. Historians seem not to have paid enough
attention to this degradation of the probability of facts, when seen
across a great many successive generations: many historical events,
reputed certain, would be at least doubtful, if submitted to this test.

In the purely mathematical sciences, the most distant consequences
partake of the certainty of the principle from which they derive. In the
applications of Analysis to Physics, the consequences have all the
certainty of facts or experiments. But in the moral sciences,
each consequence is deduced from the previous one in only a probable
way; however probable these deductions, the chance of error increases with their number, and ends up
surpassing the chance of truth, for consequences very distant from the
beginning.

**4th Principle.** When two events depend one on the other, the
probability of the compound event is the product of the probability of
the first event, by the probability that, this event having happened,
the other does. Thus, in the preceding case of three urns A, B, C, two
of which hold only white balls and one holding only black balls, the
probability of pulling a white ball out of urn C is 2/3, since of the
three urns, two contain only balls of this color. But once we have
extracted a white ball from urn C, the uncertainty regarding which of
the urns contains only black balls now carrying only to urns A and B,
the probability of extracting a white ball from urn B is 1/2, and the
product of 2/3 by 1/2, or 1/3, is then the probability to extract at
one time, from the urns B and C, two white balls. Indeed, it is
necessary for this that urn A be the one of the three urns that holds
the black balls; and the probability of this case is evidently 1/3.

We see by this example the influence of past events on the probability
of future ones. Because the probability to extract a white ball from
urn B, which initially is 2/3, becomes 1/2 once we have extracted a
white ball from urn C: it would be changed to certainty if we had
extracted a black ball from the same urn. We will determine this
influence by means of the following principle, which is a corollary of
the preceding one.

**5th Principle.** If we calculate *a priori* the probability of the
event observed, and the probability of an event composed of that one
and of another which we expect; the second probability, divided by the
first, will be the probability of the expected event, given the
observed event.

Here occurs the debate stirred by a few philosophers,
touching upon the influence of the past on the probability of the
future. Let us suppose that in the game of *heads* or *tails*,
*heads* has happened more often than *tails*: by that alone, we will
be brought to believe that in the makeup of the coin there is a cause
constantly favoring this. So too, in the conduct of life, is
consistent good fortune a proof of shrewdness, which must lead us to prefer employing the fortunate.
But if by the instability of circumstances
we are continually led to a state of absolute indecision; if for
example we change to a new coin for each toss; the past can shed no
light upon the future, and it would be absurd to take it into account.

**6th Principle.**
Each of the causes to which an observed event can be attributed, is
indicated with as much greater probability, as it is more probable
that, this cause being supposed to exist, the event will take place;
the probability of existence of each one of these causes is thus a
fraction whose numerator is the probability of the event, resulting
from this cause, and whose denominator is the sum of the similar
probabilities relative to all of the causes: if these various causes
considered *a priori* are unequally probable, then one must, in place
of the probability of the event resulting from each cause, employ the
product of this probability by the possibility of the cause
itself. This is the fundamental principle of this branch of the
analysis of chance, which consists of going back from the events to
the causes. `XXX uh did that make sense?`

This principle gives the reason for attributing to regular events a
particular cause. Some philosophers have thought that these events are
less possible than the others, and that in the game of *heads* or
*tails*, for example, the combination in which *heads* occurs twenty
times in a row is less easy for nature than those where *heads* and
*tails* are intermixed in an irregular fashion. But this opinion
supposes that past events influence the possibility of future events,
which is not at all admissible. The regular combinations arrive rarely
only because they are less numerous. . . .

. . .

**7th Principle.**

The probability of a future event is the sum of the products of the
probability of each cause, given the observed event, and of the
probability that, this cause existing, the future event will take
place. The following example will clarify this principle.

Let us imagine an urn enclosing just two balls, each being either
white or black. We draw out one of these balls, then put it back into
the urn, to proceed to a new draw. Let us suppose that in the two
first draws, we have drawn two white balls; we ask the probability of
drawing a white ball again on the third draw.

We can make here only two hypotheses: either one of the balls is white
and the other black, or both are white. On the first hypothesis, the
probability of the observed event is 1/4: it is unity or certainty on
the second. Hence, by regarding these hypotheses as so many causes, we
will have, by the sixth principle, 1/5 and 4/5 for their respective
probabilities. Now, if the first hypothesis holds, the probability of
extracting a white ball on the third draw is 1/2: it equals unity
under the second hypothesis; . . .
