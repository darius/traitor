. . . One can't deny that, since the renewal of letters among us, we
owe in part to dictionaries the general light that's spread into
society, and the seed of science that gradually disposes minds to
deeper learning. Hence how important it would be to have in this way a
book that may be consulted on every matter, and serve as much to guide
those feeling the courage to work at the instruction of others, as to
enlighten those who instruct only themselves!

This is one advantage we have proposed to ourselves; but not the only
one. In reducing to dictionary form all that concerns the sciences and
arts, it aims further to make felt the mutual aid they lend one
another; to use this aid to render the principles surer, and
consequences clearer; to indicate the distant or direct relations of
the beings that compose Nature and occupy men; to show, by the
interlacing of the roots and the branches, the impossibility of
knowing well some part of the whole, without climbing and descending
to manifold others; to form a general tableau of the work of the human
mind from all the genres and ages; to present these objects clearly;
to give to each its suitable extent, and to prove, if possible, our
epigraph by our success:

> Tantum series juncturaque pollet,  
Tantum de medio sumptis accedit honoris!  
Horat. *de Arte. poet.*, v. 249.

```
Perhaps:
Such power in order and arrangement
Taken of the ordinary, confers so much honor!
(N.B. I don't know Latin.)
