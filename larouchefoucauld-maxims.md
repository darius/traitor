## Moral reflections

### Our virtues, most often, are but vices disguised.

1. What we take for virtues are often only a congeries of doings and
interests, that chance or our industry know how to arrange; and it is
not always by courage and chastity that men are brave, and women
chaste.

2. Ego is the greatest of all toadies.

3. Whatever discovery one has made in the realm of ego, there
remain still further lands unknown.

4. Ego is more artful than the cleverest man in the world.

5. The persistence of our passions is no more up to us than the span
of our life.

6. Often passion makes a fool of the cleverest man, and the silliest crafty.

7. Those grand and striking deeds that blind the eyes are portrayed by
the powerful as due to great designs, yet mostly owe to temperament
and the passions. So the war between Augustus and Antony, ascribed to their
ambition to be masters of all, might be simply a sequel to jealousy.

8. The passions are the sole orators who always persuade. They are
like a natural art whose rules never fail; and the simplest man who
has passion sways better than the smoothest who has none.

9. The passions have an unfairness and self-interest that make them
risky to follow, deserving challenge even when seeming the most
reasonable.

10. There is in the human heart an endless engendering of passions,
making the ruin of one near-always the endowment of another.

11. The passions oft engender their opposites. Sometimes greed breeds
extravagance, and extravagance greed; often we are firm by weakness,
and bold by shyness.

12. No matter what care is taken to cover one's passions with seemings
of piety and honor, they always appear through those veils.

13. Our self-regard more impatiently suffers the censure of our tastes
than of our opinions.

14. Men are not only prone to forgetting their blessings and insults;
they even hate those they owe, and stop hating those who do them
evil. The effort of honoring the favor, and revenging the ill, seems to
them a sore servitude to bend to.

15. The mercy of princes is often but a tactic to win the people's
affection.

16. This clemency made into a virtue is enacted now by vanity,
now by sloth, often by fear, and nearly always by all three.

17. A happy person's moderation comes from the calm that good fortune
gives their nature.

18. Moderation is a fear of falling into the envy and contempt earned
by those enfeebled by their good luck; an empty show of our mental
strength; and lastly in the most elevated men a wish to seem greater
than their fortune.

19. We all have ample strength to bear the hurts of others.

20. The sages' equanimity is but the art of shutting turmoil up
within their heart.

21. Those condemned to torture affect sometimes an equanimity and
contempt for death which come really out of fearing to imagine it. So
one might say the equanimity and contempt are to their mind what a
blindfold is to their eyes.

22. Philosophy easily triumphs over ills past and future. Yet present
ills prevail.

23. Few are acquainted with death. We suffer it not usually by
resolution, but by stupidity and custom; and the bulk of men die
because it cannot be prevented.
*(I'm more than usually at sea here.)*

24. When the great are struck by lengthy misfortunes, they show
they're only supported by the strength of their ambition, not their
soul's. They show a great vanity near to the heroes being made like
other men.
*(Ditto.)*

25. Greater virtues are needed to withstand good fortune than ill.

26. One cannot gaze at either the sun or death.

27. We often boast even the most criminal passions; but envy is a
passion too timid and ashamed to dare avowal.

*(Suppressed from the first edition:)*

Ego is the love of self and of all things for oneself; it makes
men idolaters of themselves, and tyrants of others, should fortune give
them the means. It never settles outside the self, and only pauses on
foreign matters as bees will on flowers, to gather up what's theirs.

Naught is so impulsive as its desires, naught so secret as its
designs, naught so artful as its driving; its agilities are beyond
depiction, its evolutions surpass any metamorphosis, its subtleties
all of chemistry.
We cannot sound the depth nor pierce the shadows of its abysses:
there, it is under cover from the most penetrating eyes; it makes a
thousand undetectable twists and turns; there it is often invisible to
itself; there it conceives, nurtures, and raises, without being
known, a great number of likings and hates; of some it shapes such
monsters that, should they be lit by day, it misconstrues them,
or cannot be brought to acknowledge them.
From this night that shrouds it are born the absurd persuasions it has of
itself; from there come its errors, oversights, crudities, and follies
of self-regard; thus it supposes its feelings dead when only
dormant, and all yearning to run gone once it rests; it thinks lost all
the tastes it's appeased.

But this dense darkness, which hides it from itself, does not stop it
from perfectly seeing its surroundings; in this it resembles our eyes,
which discover all, blind only regarding themselves.
Indeed in its greatest interests and essential affairs, where the
violence of its wishes calls all of its attention, it sees, smells,
hears, imagines, suspects, probes into, intuits all; and so we are tempted to
believe that every passion has a sort of magic of its own.

Nothing is so near and strong as its attachments, which it tries
vainly to break upon seeing the unhappy extremes that threaten
it.
Yet sometimes it performs in scant time, with no effort, what it
could not do with all its means in the course of
years; implying rather plausibly that it's by itself that its desires are
ignited, not by the beauty and merit of its objects; that its
taste is the mark that accents them, and the rouge that adorns them;
that it's after itself that it runs, and it is following its whim, when it
follows the things that are to its whim.

It is all the opposites: imperious and servile, sincere and
dissembling, forgiving and cruel, timid and rash. It has different
leanings for the various tempers that turn it, and pledges
now to glory, now riches, now pleasures; so it changes with the
changing of our ages, our fortunes, and our experiences, but cares not
whether it have many or one humor, for it divides and rejoins as
needed, and as it pleases. It is fickle, and beyond the changes
caused from without, it has an infinity born in itself, of
its own spring; it is fickle in its fickleness, its lightness, loves,
novelties, weariness, and disgust; it is capricious, and is seen
at times to work with ultimate ardor, and with incredible
efforts, to gain bootless things, even harmful ones, but pursued
because it wants them. It is peculiar, and often puts all its effort
into the most frivolous works; it finds all its pleasure in the most
banal; and keeps all its pride in the most
contemptible.  It is in all states of life, and all conditions; it
lives everywhere, and on everything, and on
nothing; it adjusts itself to all things, and to their removal;
it even takes the part of those who war on it,
it enters into their designs; and, what's admirable, it hates itself
with them, it conjures its own defeat, it works even for its ruin. In
the end it cares only for being, and provided that it be, it wants
even to be its enemy. Do not marvel then if it accords sometimes
with the harshest severity, and enters so boldly into society therewith
to be destroyed, because just when it's ruined in one spot, it is
reestablished in another; when it thinks it's quitting its pleasure, it
only suspends or alters it, and even when conquered and
believing itself so, it finds triumph in its own defeat. See here the
picture of ego, all life a great and lengthy agitation thereof.
Picture it as the sea: the ego finding, in the
waves' restless ebb and flow, a faithful expression of
its turbulent succession of thoughts, and of its eternal movements.
