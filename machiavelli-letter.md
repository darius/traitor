Machiavelli to Francesco Vettori

Magnificent ambassador:

Divine grace is never late. I say this, because I seem to have lost,
no, strayed from your grace, as you've gone rather long without
writing me; and I wonder what could be the cause. And on all that come
to mind I count but little, save when I suppose you have recoiled from
writing me because you'd been written to that I was not a good warden
of your letters; and I know that, besides Filippo and Pagolo, no
others via me have seen them. . .

. . .Comes the evening, I return home and enter my study; and at the
threshold I strip off that daily garb, full of mud and mire, and put
on royal and curial clothing; and thus invested, I enter into the
age-old courts of the ancients, where, by them warmly welcomed, I
partake of that food which is mine alone and for which I'm born; where
I'm not ashamed to speak with them and ask the reasons for their
actions; and they by their humanity answer me; and through four hours
of time I feel no boredom, I forget all worry, I don't fear poverty, I
am not dismayed by death: I give myself wholly to them. . .

```
As I don't know Italian, it was quixotic to even attempt this one.
The first paragraph has the tenses all wrong; but on seeing a less-wrong
rendering I find myself thinking it smoother in present tense:
so this time I'm not fixing it. Proverb as license!
