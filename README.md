# Traduttore, traditore
My translations to English of selections from works whose originals are in the public domain.

It should go without saying that translation is not endorsement. I
hope for this practice to improve my ear for both French and English,
and sometimes to induce me to read the classics closely.

The repository name is meant rather more as a reminder than as
license.
