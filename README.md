# Traduttore, tradittore
My translations to English of selections from works whose originals are in the public domain.

It should go without saying that translation is not endorsement. I
hope for this practice to improve my ear for both French and English,
sometimes to induce me to read the classics closely.

The repository name is meant rather more as a reminder than as
license.
